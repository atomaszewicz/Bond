# Analyzing the James Bond Film Franchise

We open RStudio, and begin by changing our directory to that which contains the James Bond data.

```R
setwd("C:/Users/Alex/Documents/Data/Movies/Franchise/Bond")
```

Then we load a package to handle Excel files (since I saved my cleaned-up Exif CSV as an Excel ".xlsx" file), our favorite graph creating package and a tool to reshape our data.
```R
install.packages("xlsx") 
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("reshape2")
require("xlsx")
require("ggplot2")
require("reshape2")
```

At this point, I have already scraped the data from the individual pages into an [excel spreadsheet](https://github.com/atomaszewicz/Bond/blob/master/Data/jb_raw.xlsx). You can read more about the sources of this data, you can look at the [Data folder](https://github.com/atomaszewicz/Bond/tree/master/Data) or the [README](https://github.com/atomaszewicz/Bond/blob/master/Data/README.md) in the Data folder.

We now bring this data into RStudio, creating seperate variables for the seperate pages of the excel spreadsheet:

```R
#We make data frames with the data from: Box Office Mojo (bom), The Numbers (numb), and the rating websites (rate)
bom<-read.xlsx("jb_clean.xlsx",1)
numb<-read.xlsx("jb_clean.xlsx",2)
rate<-read.xlsx("jb_clean.xlsx",3)
```

## Ratings
To begin, I want to look at how the different sites average ratings relate.

```R
#We make variables for each rating type, as well as the average of the 4, then make a table of the values
#Note that all the ratings have been set to be out of 100
avg_rtc<-mean(rate$RT.Crit)
avg_rtu<-mean(rate$RT.User)
avg_Ltbx<-mean(rate$LetterBoxd)
avg_imdb<-mean(rate$IMDB)
avg_all<-mean(c(avg_imdb,avg_Ltbx,avg_rtc,avg_rtu))
avgs<-data.frame(RT.Crit=(avg_rtc),RT.User=(avg_rtu),LetterBoxd=(avg_Ltbx),IMDB=(avg_imdb),Avg.All=(avg_all))
```
Now we wish to visualize this:

```R
#Since our 'avgs' data frame is in table form, we create a new, transposed, dataframe using 'melt()' from the reshape2 library
avgs_t<-melt(avgs)
avg_rating_plot<-ggplot(avgs_t,aes(x=variable,y=value))+geom_col()+coord_cartesian(ylim=c(60,80))
labels<-xlab("Rating Metric")+ylab("Average Score/100")+ggtitle("Bond Film Average Rating by Metric")
```
![avg_rating_plot](https://github.com/atomaszewicz/Bond/blob/master/RStudio/Plots/avg_rating.png)

It seems that Rotten Tomatoe users think lower of these films than users do critics, with the average user rating being about 9% less than the critic ratings. This is an interesting result because in a FiveThirtyEight [article](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/fandango-movies-ratings/) where they compare online movie ratings for 200 titles, Rotten Tomatoes user ratings were 19% higher [^1] than Rotten Tomatoes critic scores. Even in an intuitive sense I expected critics to be more ... critical of movies than your average Joe Rotten Tomatoes. It is a critics job to judge movies, they are presumably more hardened against nostalgia and flashy explosions than your average theater-goer. On the other hand, critics probably better understand the place of the James Bond movies while our average theater-goer is keeping their score of Citizen Kane or Lawrence of Arabia in mind when they pencil in their rating for the 007 films, but I digress.

The average for all the Bond films, based on the 4 metrics of choice, is about 71/100, which translates to a 3.5/5 star rating or a C+ (on B.C.'s highschool grading scale). 

plot_avgs<-ggplot(avgs1,aes(x=variable))+geom_col(aes(y=value))+coord_cartesian(ylim=c(60,80))+xlab("Rating")+ylab("Average Score/100")+ggtitle("Bond Film Average Ratings by Metric")









 


Footnotes:
[^1] : In the FiveThirtyEight [article](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/fandango-movies-ratings/) I referenced, the point of interest
is this paragraph: "The ratings from IMDb, Metacritic and Rotten Tomatoes were typically in the same ballpark, which makes this finding unsurprising: Fandangoâ€™s star rating was higher than the IMDb rating 79 percent of the time, the Metacritic aggregate critic score 77 percent of the time, the Metacritic user score 86 percent of the time, the Rotten Tomatoes critic score 62 percent of the time, and the Rotten Tomatoes user score 74 percent of the time." Therefore to see how much higher user scores are than the critics scores, we simply divide the two averages to eliminate the Fandango term: RT.Crit / RT. User =1.19 which gives us our quoted 19%.
