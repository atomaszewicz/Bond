# IMDB
The ratings used for the James Bond franchise can be found [here](http://www.imdb.com/list/ls055107293/?start=1&view=detail&sort=release_date_us:asc&defaults=1&scb=0.9465706193338981). This is not an official IMDB list (IMDB does not have a section for film franchises), it is made by an IMDB user, but it has all the films, so we use it.
