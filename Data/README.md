This folder provides links to all the online sources I used for data, it also contains a file "jb_clean.xlsx" that contains all the information pulled from these sources. This spreadsheet is split into 3 pages, the first being 'BOM' for Box Office Mojo data, the second 'Num' for The Numbers data and 'Rate' for all the online rating data together. The data in this file is not the raw data pulled from the website, it is cleaned and adjusted for relevance to the project.
