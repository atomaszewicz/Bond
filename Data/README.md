# Data Overview
This folder provides links to all the online sources I used for data, it also contains a file "jb_clean.xlsx" that contains all the information pulled from these sources. This spreadsheet is split into 3 pages, the first being 'BOM' for Box Office Mojo data, the second 'Num' for The Numbers data and 'Rate' for all the online rating data together. The data in this file is not the raw data pulled from the website, it is cleaned and adjusted for relevance to the project. This step mostly involved changing date formats, removing irrelevant columns, and changing all the ratings to be out of 100. 

## Aquiring
To aquire this data from the various websites, I used the Excel feature of going onto the web and copying tables into Excel. To do this (in Excel 2016), you can navigate to the 'Data' tab, choose the 'From Web' option, navigate the interet explorer to the relevant website, then click on the arrow next to the table you want to bring into Excel. This method does a very good job of bringing the same formatting to Excel as was on the website. Here is a picture showing (1) where to find the 'From Web' option and (2) how selecting a table in the internet explorer: ![excel_scrape](https://github.com/atomaszewicz/Bond/blob/master/excel_scrape.png)
