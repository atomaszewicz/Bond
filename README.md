# Bond

6 Actors, 25 films, over $7 billion in box office gross (adjusted for inflation), and innumerable car chases, gadgets, martinis and babes, Agent 007 is one of film's most iconic characters. Ranked as the fourth most financially successful film franchise in history (after Star Wars, Harry Potter, and Marvel, in that order) 

The mixture of exaggerated villainy, epic heroism and bad puns is just right to keep us from taking these films too seriously.

One thing missing from this analysis is the amount paid to an actor for a given film. That is because this info is missing for many films and when it is there, it is rather complicated as some actors recieved just a paycheck while some recieved a percentage of net merch or film gross.
